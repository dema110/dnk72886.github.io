		</p>
		<p> 
			As the first business school in the South, the Terry College of Business is steeped in a tradition 
			of providing cutting-edge business education to its students. Our challenging curriculum, 
			exceptional faculty, and close-knit alumni network ensure that Terry students are prepared to 
			become the next generation of leaders.
		</p>

			<h4> Terry believes in nurturing success </h4>
			<p>As a Top 20 public business school, we believe that hard work creates a culture of 
			success wherein students learn to be leaders. That leadership, in turn, results in more 
			successful careers for our students, more successful businesses in our state and in our 
			country, and greater economic development in our communities.</p>

			<h4> Terry believes in supporting its faculty </h4>
			<p>We support our faculty in their teaching and research activities. We believe in recognizing 
			faculty for producing high quality scholarship which improves business processes and fuels 
			firm performance. We also encourage faculty to incorporate innovative pedagogy into their 
			courses so that our students’ curriculum is rigorous, engaging, and prepares our graduates 
			for success when they enter the work force.</p>

			<h4>Terry believes in developing its students</h4>

			<p>We work hard to provide students with an education that inspires critical thinking and 
			encourages creative problem solving. Undergraduate students, graduate students, and
			executive education students – each one of our students is important to us. We offer 
			diverse learning opportunities – including a student-managed investment fund, a sales lab, 
			internships, study abroad programs, certificate programs in entrepreneurship, music business,
			actuarial science, legal studies, workforce diversity and leadership development – 
			to prepare our students for the global economy.</p>

			<h4>Terry believes in making a difference</h4>
			<p>At Terry, we believe a business education is incomplete if students do not embrace a sense 
			of service and responsibility to their own communities. We take great pride in our efforts to 
			support economic development in the State of Georgia and its role in the global economy. Our 
			Economic Outlook series provides businesses and public officials with current economic data 
			needed to make informed decisions and each year, roughly 3,000 state leaders attend our annual 
			forecast presentations. Our commitment to service can also be seen in our wide array of 
			executive education programs and in the multitude of student course projects and volunteer 
			activities our students perform to better their communities.</p>

			<h4>Terry believes in building lasting connections with alumni</h4>
			<p>Terry has a vast network of alumni, over 65,000 strong, who donate their time and 
			resources to this great institution. Our alumni interact with our current students through 
			speaking to classes, working with student clubs, serving as mentors, and providing job search 
			assistance. Their most notable commitment to Terry can be seen in our new Learning Community 
			and its first building, Correll Hall, which has been built exclusively with private donations.

			Our teaching, our research, and our service all reflect the core values of the Terry College 
			of Business. Come join our future!</p>
